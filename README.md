This Minecraft Server is a way to host Java-client and Bedrock-client players at the same time!

The other purpose of this server is handling plugins of both of these clients!

For the third purpose of this server, i'm going to make the server handle and compile both clients mods and add-ons!

I planned to bring a complete cross-platform and cross-play to Minecraft!
